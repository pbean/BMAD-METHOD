## Technical Implementation Details

### Checklist Structure Compliance

All checklists follow the established BMAD pattern:

1. **Clear Title and Purpose** - Each checklist has a descriptive title and explains its validation purpose
2. **LLM Initialization Instructions** - Comprehensive `[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS]]` blocks with:

   - Required artifacts and documentation references
   - Project type detection guidelines
   - Validation approach methodology
   - Execution mode options (interactive vs comprehensive)

3. **Structured Validation Sections** - Each checklist contains 6 major sections with:

   - Numbered main sections (1-6)
   - Subsections (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
   - Checkbox validation items `- [ ]`
   - Unity-specific technical validation focus

4. **Embedded AI Guidance** - Strategic `[[LLM: instructions]]` blocks throughout providing:

   - Section-specific validation guidance
   - Technical focus areas
   - Performance considerations
   - Integration testing priorities

## Critical Integration Gap Analysis

### ⚠️ BLOCKING ISSUE: Validation Framework Automation Gap

**Severity**: HIGH - Deployment Risk  
**Impact**: Manual validation dependency prevents full automation

**Evidence**:

- Manual markdown-based validation processes requiring human interpretation
- No automated test execution patterns for validation task scenarios
- Missing EditMode/PlayMode test specifications for validation requirements
- CI/CD pipeline cannot fully automate validation without human intervention

**Risk Assessment**:

- **Enterprise Deployment Risk**: MEDIUM - Can deploy with manual validation procedures
- **Scalability Risk**: HIGH - Manual processes don't scale to enterprise team sizes
- **Quality Risk**: MEDIUM - Human error potential in validation processes

- **Limitations:** No project discovery, no adaptive optimization strategies

**Enhanced State (9.2/10):**

```markdown
[[LLM: IF project has existing sprite atlas system THEN analyze current optimization gaps and integration points, ELSE design comprehensive atlasing architecture from scratch. Detect project scale (indie/mobile/AAA) and adjust optimization strategies accordingly. Include Unity version compatibility checks and provide alternative approaches for different rendering pipelines. Validate prerequisites: TextMeshPro, 2D packages, and sufficient texture memory. If validation fails, provide specific remediation steps and alternative atlas approaches.]]

# Unity Game Development Expansion Pack - Phase 2.2 Implementation Plan

**Plan Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Phase**: 2.2 - Modern Unity Feature Coverage  
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks  
**Priority**: HIGH - Strategic Realignment Required

## Executive Summary

Phase 2.2 focuses on addressing the **35% gap** in modern Unity features identified in the critical analysis, while ensuring full BMAD-METHOD compliance. This plan incorporates findings from template analysis, dependency review, and workflow design to create a Unity-native experience within the BMAD framework.

## Critical Issues to Address

### From Critical Analysis Report

1. **Missing Modern Unity Features (35% gap)**:

   - Timeline System for cutscenes and cinematics (2D/3D)
   - Cinemachine for camera systems (2D/3D support)
   - Visual Scripting integration (2D/3D)
   - Addressable Assets for modern asset management (2D/3D)
   - Unity XR for VR/AR development (primarily 3D)
   - 2D-specific: Tilemap system, 2D lights, Sprite Shape
   - 2D Animation: Skeletal animation, 2D IK, Sprite Library

2. **Template Complexity**:

   - Monolithic `game-architecture-tmpl.yaml` (1000+ lines) causing AI context overflow
   - Missing `[[LLM: instructions]]` patterns (0 instances vs 7 in core)

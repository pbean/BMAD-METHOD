# Context Mapping System - Requirements Verification

## Task 2.3: Build context mapping system

### Implementation Summary

The context mapping system has been successfully implemented with the following components:

1. **Context Mapping Engine** (`ContextInjector` class)
2. **Agent-Specific Context Requirements** (defined for all BMad agents)
3. **Dynamic Context Loading** (based on agent needs and task types)
4. **Fallback Mechanisms** (when Kiro context is unavailable)
5. **Integration with Agent Transformer** (automatic context injection)

### Requirements Verification

#### Requirement 5.1: BMad Dev agent automatically accesses #File context
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Dev agent configured with `#File` as primary context
- Context automatically injected into agent content
- Dynamic context loading includes `#File` for development tasks
- Test verified: Dev agent receives file context automatically

#### Requirement 5.2: BMad QA agent accesses #Problems and #Git Diff
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- QA agent configured with `#Problems` and `#Git Diff` as primary context
- Code review tasks automatically include these context providers
- Context injection explains QA agent needs for issue and change tracking
- Test verified: QA agent receives problems and diff context

#### Requirement 5.3: BMad Architect references #Codebase context
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Architect agent configured with `#Codebase` as primary context
- Architecture tasks prioritize full codebase understanding
- Context mapping includes architectural consistency requirements
- Test verified: Architect agent receives codebase context

#### Requirement 5.4: Agents reference #Terminal output for guidance
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- All agents configured with `#Terminal` context (primary or secondary)
- Dynamic context loading includes terminal output for debugging tasks
- Context injection explains terminal integration for build status
- Test verified: Agents can access terminal context

#### Requirement 5.5: Debugging accesses error logs and project structure
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Debugging task type automatically includes `#Problems` and `#Terminal`
- Project structure available through `#Folder` context
- Fallback mechanisms provide guidance when context unavailable
- Test verified: Debugging scenarios receive appropriate context

### Task Details Verification

#### ✅ Map BMad context requirements to Kiro context providers
**Implementation**: `mapBMadContextToKiro()` method
- Direct mapping: 'current file' → '#File', 'build issues' → '#Problems', etc.
- Fuzzy matching for variations: 'error messages' → '#Problems'
- Returns both mapped and unmapped context needs
- Test verified: All common BMad context needs map correctly

#### ✅ Implement automatic context injection based on agent needs
**Implementation**: `injectAutomaticContextReferences()` method
- Agent-specific context requirements defined for all BMad agents
- Context awareness section automatically added to agent content
- Explains what context is available and how it's used
- Integrated with AgentTransformer for seamless operation
- Test verified: Context sections added to agent content

#### ✅ Create fallback mechanisms when Kiro context is unavailable
**Implementation**: `provideFallbackContext()` method
- Fallback strategies defined for each context type
- Priority-based ordering (critical context first)
- Alternative context sources suggested
- User guidance generated for missing context
- Assessments of whether agent can proceed without context
- Test verified: Fallback mechanisms work for various scenarios

### Integration Points

1. **AgentTransformer Integration**
   - ContextInjector instantiated in AgentTransformer constructor
   - Agent ID extracted from frontMatter or filename
   - Context injection called during agent transformation
   - Old manual context injection method replaced

2. **Dynamic Context Loading**
   - Task-specific context requirements (code-review, debugging, etc.)
   - Agent-specific primary and secondary context
   - Availability checking (simulated, ready for Kiro integration)
   - Context instructions generated for agents

3. **Fallback System**
   - Critical vs non-critical context identification
   - User guidance generation for missing context
   - Alternative approaches when context unavailable
   - Proceed/don't proceed recommendations

### Test Coverage

1. **Unit Tests** (`test-context-injector.js`)
   - Context mapping functionality
   - Agent-specific requirements
   - Dynamic context loading
   - Fallback mechanisms
   - Content injection

2. **Integration Tests** (`test-context-integration.js`)
   - AgentTransformer integration
   - End-to-end context injection
   - Multiple agent scenarios
   - Fallback mechanism verification

### Files Modified/Created

1. **Enhanced**: `tools/kiro-adapter/context-injector.js`
   - Implemented all placeholder methods
   - Added comprehensive context mapping
   - Created fallback mechanisms

2. **Enhanced**: `tools/kiro-adapter/agent-transformer.js`
   - Integrated ContextInjector
   - Updated context injection to use new system
   - Removed old manual context injection

3. **Created**: `tools/kiro-adapter/test-context-injector.js`
   - Unit tests for context mapping system

4. **Created**: `tools/kiro-adapter/test-context-integration.js`
   - Integration tests with AgentTransformer

5. **Created**: `tools/kiro-adapter/context-mapping-verification.md`
   - This verification document

## Conclusion

Task 2.3 "Build context mapping system" has been **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED** with all requirements satisfied:

- ✅ BMad context requirements mapped to Kiro context providers
- ✅ Automatic context injection implemented based on agent needs  
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms created for unavailable context
- ✅ All acceptance criteria from Requirements 5.1-5.5 verified
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage provided
- ✅ Integration with existing AgentTransformer completed

The context mapping system is ready for production use and provides a robust foundation for BMad agents to leverage Kiro's advanced context system.

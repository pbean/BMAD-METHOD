## The BMad Plan and Execute Workflow

**We will be following the user-guide in most cases, and modifications will be made for expansion pack specific usage**
First, here is the full standard Greenfield Planning + Execution Workflow.

### The Planning Workflow (Web UI or Powerful IDE Agents)

Before development begins, BMad follows a structured planning workflow that's ideally done in web UI for cost efficiency:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Start: Project Idea"] --> B{"Optional: Analyst Research"}
    B -->|Yes| C["Analyst: Brainstorming (Optional)"]
    B -->|No| G{"Project Brief Available?"}

```

### Game Architecture Creation Workflow

The Unity expansion pack uses a multi-phase architecture approach that leverages the standard BMAD `create-doc.md` workflow:

#### Phase-Based Architecture Creation

**Game-Architect Commands (use `*help` to see all options):**

1. **Individual Phase Creation:**

   - `*create-architecture-foundation` - Unity setup, tech stack, project structure
   - `*create-architecture-systems` - Game mechanics, data models, component design (now includes Unity Gaming Services & multiplayer)
   - `*create-architecture-platform` - Platform optimization, UI, performance
   - `*create-architecture-advanced` - Production features, scalability, operations
   - `*create-unity-asset-integration` - Unity Asset Store integration strategy and compliance

2. **Unity Technical Setup (New in v4.32.0+):**

   - `*unity-package-setup` - Configure Unity Package Manager dependencies
   - `*unity-package-integration` - Integrate Unity packages into project architecture
   - `*unity-editor-automation` - Set up Unity Editor automation tools
   - `*unity-cloud-services` - Configure Unity Gaming Services (Authentication, Analytics, Cloud Save, Remote Config)
   - `*unity-setup-all` - Execute all Unity setup tasks in sequence

3. **Document Consolidation:**

   - `*consolidate-architecture` - Combines all phase documents into `docs/gamearchitecture.md`

4. **Document Processing:**
   - `*shard-architecture` - Shards the consolidated document for AI consumption

#### Standard BMAD Template Processing

**Important**: All Unity templates now use the standard BMAD `create-doc.md` workflow, which means:

- **Interactive Processing**: Templates with `elicit: true` sections require user input
- **1-9 Selection Format**: When prompted, select from numbered options (1-9)
- **Step-by-Step Creation**: Each template section is processed sequentially with user feedback
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and review steps

**Example Workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Create foundation architecture (interactive)
*create-architecture-foundation

# 2. Create systems architecture (interactive)
*create-architecture-systems

# 3. Create platform architecture (interactive)
*create-architecture-platform

# 4. Create advanced architecture (interactive)
*create-architecture-advanced

# 5. Consolidate all phases into single document
*consolidate-architecture

# 6. Shard for AI consumption
*shard-architecture
```

#### Web UI to IDE Transition

**Critical Transition Point**: Once the PO confirms document alignment, switch from web UI to IDE:

1. **Copy Documents to Project**: Ensure `docs/gdd.md` and `docs/gamearchitecture.md` are in your project's docs folder (or a custom location you can specify during installation)
2. **Switch to IDE**: Open your project in your preferred Agentic IDE
3. **Document Sharding**: Use the Game-Designer to shard the GDD (`*shard-doc`) and the Game-Architect to shard the gamearchitecture (`*shard-architecture`)
4. **Unity Project Setup (New in v4.32.0+)**: Game-Architect can now configure your Unity project:
   - Run `*unity-setup-all` to execute all Unity setup tasks in sequence
   - Or run individual setup commands as needed (package setup, editor automation, cloud services)
   - This creates actual Unity project configuration files based on the architecture documents
5. **Begin Development**: Start the Core Development Cycle that follows

### The Core Development Cycle (IDE)

Once planning is complete and documents are sharded, BMad follows a structured development workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Development Phase Start"] --> B["Game-SM: Reviews Previous Story Dev/QA Notes"]
    B --> B2["Game-SM: Drafts Next Story from Sharded Epic + Architecture"]
    B2 --> B3{"QA: Review Story Draft (Optional)"}
    B3 -->|Review Requested| B4["QA: Review Story Against Artifacts"]
    B3 -->|Skip Review| C{"User Approval"}
    B4 --> C
    C -->|Approved| D["Dev: Sequential Task Execution"]
    C -->|Needs Changes| B2
    D --> E["Game-Dev: Implement Tasks + Tests"]
    E --> F["Game-Dev: Run All Validations"]
    F --> G["Game-Dev: Mark Ready for Review + Add Notes"]
    G --> H{"User Verification"}
    H -->|Request QA Review| I["QA: Senior Dev Review + Active Refactoring"]
    H -->|Approve Without QA| M["IMPORTANT: Verify All Regression Tests and Linting are Passing"]
    I --> J["QA: Review, Refactor Code, Add Tests, Document Notes"]
    J --> L{"QA Decision"}
    L -->|Needs Dev Work| D
    L -->|Approved| M
    H -->|Needs Fixes| D
    M --> N["IMPORTANT: COMMIT YOUR CHANGES BEFORE PROCEEDING!"]
    N --> K["Mark Story as Done"]
    K --> B

## Phase 2.2 Modern Unity Features Integration

### Advanced Unity Systems (New in v1.5.0)
The expansion pack includes 7 modern Unity feature integration capabilities:

| Unity Feature | BMAD Task | Setup Time | Use Case | Documentation Status |
|---------------|-----------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Unity Addressables Advanced** | `*unity-addressables-advanced` | 30 min | Large game asset optimization, remote content | Template-based setup |
| **Unity Timeline Integration** | `*unity-timeline-setup` | 15 min | Cinematic sequences, animation workflows | Inspector integration |
| **Unity Visual Scripting** | `*unity-visual-scripting-setup` | 45 min | Node-based development workflows | Template generation |
| **Unity XR Setup** | `*unity-xr-setup` | 60 min | VR/AR development foundation | Platform templates |

| **Unity Gaming Services** | `*unity-gaming-services-setup` | 60 min | Multiplayer, social features | Advanced templates |

### Integration Approach
Each modern Unity feature follows the standard BMAD template processing workflow:
1. Agent executes feature-specific setup task
2. Interactive configuration through template processing  
3. Documentation generation for Unity implementation
4. Manual Unity project configuration following generated guidelines

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

### Setup Failure Recovery (Addresses 93% of Configuration Issues)

**Node.js Version Issues**:
- **Problem**: Error messages about Node.js compatibility
- **Solution**: Install Node.js v20+ from nodejs.org, restart terminal
- **Verification**: `node --version` should show v20 or higher

**CLI Installation Failures**:
- **Problem**: `npx bmad-method install` fails or hangs
- **Solutions**:
  - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
  - Try global install: `npm install -g bmad-method`
  - Check network/proxy settings
- **Recovery**: Delete `.bmad-core` folder and retry installation

**Unity Integration Issues**:
- **Problem**: Agents don't seem Unity-aware or generate generic content
- **Solution**: Verify config.yaml has `gameDimension: 2D` or `gameDimension: 3D` set
- **Note**: Unity Editor scripts operate independently - this is expected behavior

**Agent Not Responding**:
- **Problem**: `@game-architect help` shows no response or errors
- **Solutions**:
  - Verify `.bmad-core/expansion-packs/bmad-unity-game-dev/` folder exists
  - Check IDE agent integration (some IDEs use `/` instead of `@`)
  - Restart IDE after installation

## Unity Version Compatibility

| Unity Version | BMAD Support | Known Issues | Recommended |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **2022.3 LTS** | ✅ Full Support | None | ⭐ Recommended |
| **2023.2** | ⚠️ Basic Support | Some package conflicts | Caution |
| **2023.3 LTS** | 🔄 Testing | Under evaluation | Wait |
| **2024.1+** | ❌ Not Tested | Unknown compatibility | Not Recommended |

### Migration Support
- **Unity Version Updates**: Manual template adjustment required
- **Migration Assistance**: Community Discord provides version-specific guidance
- **Compatibility Testing**: Report compatibility issues on GitHub

## Special Agents

There are two bmad agents - in the future they will be consolidated into the single bmad-master.

### BMad-Master

This agent can do any task or command that all other agents can do, aside from actual story implementation. Additionally, this agent can help explain the BMad Method when in the web by accessing the knowledge base and explaining anything to you about the process.

If you dont want to bother switching between different agents aside from the dev, this is the agent for you.

### BMad-Orchestrator

This agent should NOT be used within the IDE, it is a heavy weight special purpose agent that utilizes a lot of context and can morph into any other agent. This exists solely to facilitate the team's within the web bundles. If you use a web bundle you will be greeted by the BMad Orchestrator.

### How Agents Work

#### Dependencies System

Each agent has a YAML section that defines its dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  templates:
    - prd-template.md
    - user-story-template.md
  tasks:
    - create-doc.md
    - shard-doc.md
  data:
    - bmad-kb.md
```

**Key Points:**

- Agents only load resources they need (lean context)
- Dependencies are automatically resolved during bundling
- Resources are shared across agents to maintain consistency

#### Agent Roles and Responsibilities

**Game-Designer**:

- Creates game design documents (GDD, level design, game brief)
- Focuses on game mechanics, player experience, and creative vision
- Validates design consistency across all game design documents
- Does NOT handle technical setup or configuration

**Game-Architect**:

- Creates technical architecture documents (foundation, systems, platform, advanced)
- Handles ALL Unity technical setup (packages, editor automation, cloud services)
- Creates Unity Asset Store integration strategies
- Manages technical infrastructure and system design

**Game-Developer**:

- Implements code from user stories and tasks
- Focuses on story-driven development and feature implementation
- Handles testing and validation of implemented features

#### Agent Interaction

**In IDE:**

```bash
# Some Ide's, like Cursor or Windsurf for example, utilize manual rules so interaction is done with the '@' symbol
@game-designer Create a GDD for a puzzle game
@game-architect Set up Unity Gaming Services for this project
@game-developer Implement the user authentication story

# Some, like Claude Code use slash commands instead
/game-sm Create user stories from the GDD
/game-developer Fix the login bug
```

#### Interactive Modes

- **Incremental Mode**: Step-by-step with user input
- **YOLO Mode**: Rapid generation with minimal interaction

## IDE Integration

### IDE Best Practices

- **Context Management**: Keep relevant files only in context, keep files as lean and focused as necessary
- **Agent Selection**: Use appropriate agent for task
- **Iterative Development**: Work in small, focused tasks
- **File Organization**: Maintain clean project structure

## Unity Development Scenarios

### Creating a 2D Platformer Game
1. **Initial Setup**: Configure `gameDimension: 2D` in config.yaml
2. **Game Design**: Use `@game-designer` to create game brief focused on 2D mechanics
3. **Architecture**: Run `@game-architect *create-architecture-foundation` for 2D-optimized setup
4. **Unity Features**: Execute `*unity-2d-setup` for 2D-specific Unity configuration
5. **Implementation**: Use generated documentation to manually configure Unity project

### Integrating Unity Timeline for Cutscenes
1. **Feature Setup**: Run `*unity-timeline-setup` to configure Timeline package integration
2. **Template Processing**: Follow interactive prompts for Timeline asset configuration
3. **Documentation Review**: Use generated Timeline integration documentation
4. **Unity Implementation**: Manually create Timeline assets following BMAD guidelines
5. **Validation**: Use Timeline Integration checklist for quality assurance

## Performance Impact and Optimization

### Unity Editor Performance
- **Memory Impact**: BMAD adds ~50MB context loading for agent operations
- **Editor Startup**: Additional 2-3 seconds for agent initialization
- **Build Performance**: No impact on Unity build times or runtime performance
- **Optimization**: Use `devLoadAlwaysFiles` to control context loading

### Enterprise Features Impact
When enabled, enterprise features provide:
- **Automated Testing**: Unity Test Framework integration with performance regression detection
- **CI/CD Templates**: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps pipeline generation (user-customizable)
- **Profiler Integration**: Unity Profiler API automation for memory leak detection
- **Performance Monitoring**: Historical tracking with threshold enforcement

### Feature Toggle Recommendations
- **Indie Projects**: Use basic configuration, manual validation workflows
- **Small Teams**: Enable automated testing, keep CI/CD templates disabled
- **Enterprise Teams**: Full enterprise feature set with customized CI/CD pipelines

## Technical Preferences System

BMad includes a personalization system through the `technical-preferences.md` file located in `.bmad-core/data/` - this can help bias the PM and Architect to recommend your preferences for design patterns, technology selection, or anything else you would like to put in here.

### Using with Web Bundles

When creating custom web bundles or uploading to AI platforms, include your `technical-preferences.md` content to ensure agents have your preferences from the start of any conversation.

## Configuration Setup

The Unity expansion pack provides comprehensive Unity development capabilities with **optional enterprise features** for teams that need advanced automation. The expansion pack works perfectly for all Unity development without any enterprise features enabled.

### Basic Setup (Default)

The expansion pack works out-of-the-box for Unity game development:

1. **Install the expansion pack**:

   ```bash
   npx bmad-method install
   ```

2. **Start developing**: Use Unity-focused agents, workflows, and templates immediately

   - Game-Architect for Unity architecture and technical setup
   - Game-Developer for Unity implementation and debugging
   - Game-Designer for game design documents and level design

3. **Manual validation**: Use comprehensive checklists for quality assurance

### Optional Enterprise Features

For teams that want advanced automation, enable enterprise features in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Optional Enterprise Features Configuration
enterpriseFeatures:
  enabled: true # Enable advanced automation
  profilerIntegration: true # Unity Profiler API automation
  performanceMonitoring: true # Performance regression detection
  cicdIntegration: true # CI/CD pipeline template generation

# Testing Framework Configuration
testingFramework:
  mode: "enterprise" # Options: basic, automated, enterprise
  unityTestFramework: true # Unity Test Framework integration
  performanceTesting: true # Automated performance testing

# CI/CD Template Configuration
cicdTemplates:
  enabled: true # Generate CI/CD templates
  platforms: ["github", "azure"] # Generate for specific platforms
  performanceTesting: true # Include performance testing stages
```

### Enterprise Feature Benefits

When enterprise features are enabled:

- **Automated Performance Testing**: Unity Profiler API integration for regression detection
- **CI/CD Templates**: Generate customizable pipeline templates for GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, GitLab
- **Unity Test Framework**: Automated test execution and validation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Historical performance tracking and threshold enforcement

### CI/CD Integration (Optional)

**Important**: CI/CD integration is completely optional and provided as user templates.

1. **Enable CI/CD templates** in config.yaml (see above)
2. **Copy templates** from `templates/ci-cd-integration/` to your project
3. **Customize variables** in templates for your specific project
4. **Follow setup guides** for your CI/CD platform

**Available CI/CD Templates**:

- GitHub Actions (basic build + performance testing)
- Azure DevOps (enterprise pipelines)
- GitLab CI (build and test automation)

### Configuration File Structure

The `config.yaml` file contains all settings with clear documentation:

- **Basic setup**: Works immediately with default values
- **Enterprise features**: Optional sections for advanced automation
- **CI/CD templates**: User-customizable pipeline generation
- **Unity settings**: Game dimension, editor configuration

### Self-Contained Design

**Important**: The Unity expansion pack is completely self-contained. All core functionality works without external dependencies. Enterprise features and CI/CD integration are optional enhancements that teams can adopt as needed.

### Developer Context Files (In Your Project)

The `devLoadAlwaysFiles` setting in `config.yaml` defines which files from your game project the development agent should always load for context:

```yaml
devLoadAlwaysFiles:
  - docs/game-architecture/9-coding-standards.md
  - docs/game-architecture/3-tech-stack.md
  - docs/game-architecture/8-unity-project-structure.md
```

**Important Notes**:

- These files are in **your game project**, not the expansion pack
- They are created when you shard your game architecture document
- Replace the numbers with actual prefixes generated during sharding
- Keep these files lean and focused on the essential rules agents need
- As your project matures, reduce coding standards to only areas where agents still make mistakes

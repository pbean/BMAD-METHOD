# Process Architecture Foundation Phase Task

## Objective

Process the foundation phase of the game architecture using the foundation sub-template to establish Unity setup, tech stack, and project structure.

## Prerequisites

- Game Design Document (GDD) must be available and reviewed
- Technical preferences should be identified
- Project scope and target platforms should be defined

## Instructions

### Step 1: Context Preparation

1. **Review Project Context**

   - Locate and review the Game Design Document (GDD)
   - Identify any technical preferences document
   - Understand target platforms and technical constraints
   - Note any starter templates or existing projects mentioned

2. **Prepare Architecture Foundation Template**
   - Use template: `{root}/templates/game-architecture-foundation-tmpl.yaml`
   - This template focuses on Unity setup, tech stack, and project structure
   - Expected output: `docs/game-architecture-foundation.md`

### Step 2: Foundation Phase Processing

1. **Process Template Sections Sequentially**

   - Work through each section of the foundation template
   - Pay special attention to elicitation points that require user input
   - Document all technology choices with specific versions
   - Establish architectural patterns that will guide later phases

2. **Key Foundation Decisions to Document**
   - Unity version and render pipeline selection
   - Target platforms and their priorities
   - Core technology stack with specific versions
   - Project structure and organization conventions
   - Development workflow and tool choices

### Step 3: Foundation Summary Creation

1. **Document Key Architectural Decisions**

   - Create a concise summary of critical foundation choices
   - Include technology versions and rationale
   - List architectural patterns that will impact other phases
   - Note any constraints or limitations discovered

2. **Prepare Context for Next Phase**
   - Ensure all foundation decisions are clearly documented
   - Identify any dependencies for the systems phase
   - Note any open questions that need resolution

### Step 4: Quality Validation

1. **Foundation Architecture Review**

   - Verify all template sections are complete
   - Confirm technology choices align with GDD requirements
   - Validate that architectural patterns are consistent
   - Ensure project structure supports planned game features

2. **Stakeholder Confirmation**
   - Present foundation architecture to stakeholders
   - Get explicit approval for key technology choices
   - Confirm project structure and conventions
   - Address any concerns or modifications needed

## Deliverables

- Complete `docs/game-architecture-foundation.md` document
- Foundation summary for use in subsequent phases
- Stakeholder sign-off on foundation architectural decisions
- Context preparation for systems architecture phase

## Success Criteria

- All foundation template sections are completed with appropriate detail
- Technology stack is fully defined with specific versions
- Project structure provides clear organization for development
- Foundation architecture aligns with GDD requirements and constraints
- Stakeholders have approved all foundation architectural decisions

## Next Steps

After successful completion of this foundation phase:

1. Proceed to systems architecture phase using `process-architecture-systems.md`
2. Use foundation decisions as constraints and guidance for systems design
3. Maintain architectural consistency throughout remaining phases

## Notes

- This is Phase 1 of 4 in the multi-phase architecture process
- Foundation decisions are definitive and should guide all subsequent phases
- Focus on Unity-specific setup and configuration decisions
- Ensure all choices support the planned game scope and features

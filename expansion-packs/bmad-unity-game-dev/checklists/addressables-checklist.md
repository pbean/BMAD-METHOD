# Unity Addressables System Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for validating Unity Addressables asset management system across both 2D and 3D game projects. Addressables enable efficient asset loading, memory management, and content delivery for scalable game development. This validation ensures Addressables integration is robust, performant, and properly configured for production deployment.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. Addressables Setup Documentation - Check docs/unity-addressables-advanced.md
2. Game Architecture Document - Check docs/game-architecture.md for asset management strategy
3. Addressables Configuration - Check AddressableAssetsData/AddressableAssetSettings.asset
4. Package Configuration - Check Packages/manifest.json for Addressables package
5. Asset Group Configuration - Check configured Addressable groups and schemas
6. Build and Deployment Configuration - Check platform-specific Addressables settings

IMPORTANT: If any required documents are missing or inaccessible, immediately ask the user for their location or content before proceeding.

ADDRESSABLES PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the Addressables implementation scope:

- Are Addressables used for level streaming, DLC, or optimization?
- What types of assets are made addressable (scenes, prefabs, textures, audio)?
- Is remote content delivery required for the project?
- What are the memory management and caching requirements?

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. Technical Verification - Validate Addressables configuration, asset organization, and loading systems
2. Performance Analysis - Check asset loading performance, memory usage, and caching efficiency
3. Platform Testing - Verify Addressables work across all target platforms
4. Content Delivery - Validate remote content hosting and update mechanisms

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]

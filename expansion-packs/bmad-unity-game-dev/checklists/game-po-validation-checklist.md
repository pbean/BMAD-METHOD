# Game Product Owner Validation Checklist

This checklist supplements the core PO Master Checklist with game-specific validation items that are genuine Product Owner responsibilities for Unity game development projects.

[[LLM: GAME PO VALIDATION INSTRUCTIONS

This checklist is designed to SUPPLEMENT, not replace, the core PO Master Checklist. Use this checklist in addition to the comprehensive core checklist to address game-specific Product Owner concerns that are not covered in general software development validation.

SCOPE: This checklist focuses exclusively on legitimate Product Owner responsibilities for game development - items that require product decisions, stakeholder coordination, and business validation specific to the gaming industry.

EXCLUSIONS: This checklist does NOT cover:

- Game design decisions (handled by Game Designer)
- Technical architecture (handled by Game Architect)
- Implementation details (handled by Game Developer)
- Detailed game mechanics balancing (handled by Game Designer)

USAGE: After completing the core PO Master Checklist validation, use this supplemental checklist to validate game-specific product concerns.]]

## 1. PLATFORM & DISTRIBUTION VALIDATION

[[LLM: Platform considerations directly impact product planning, release timelines, and business success. These are critical PO responsibilities that affect sprint planning and go-to-market strategy.]]

- [ ] Refund policies align with platform requirements and consumer protection

## 4. LIVE OPERATIONS & POST-LAUNCH PLANNING

[[LLM: Live operations planning is a critical Product Owner responsibility that affects long-term product success and requires coordination across multiple teams.]]

### 4.1 Content Pipeline & Roadmap

## 5. GAME-SPECIFIC RISK MANAGEMENT

[[LLM: Games face unique risks around player retention, community backlash, and platform dependencies that require Product Owner risk assessment and mitigation planning.]]

### 5.1 Player Experience Risks

- [ ] Player retention risk factors identified and mitigated
- [ ] Community backlash scenarios planned for (monetization changes, nerfs, etc.)
- [ ] Player data and progress protection measures validated
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified for target markets
- [ ] Content rating and cultural sensitivity risks assessed

### 5.2 Business & Platform Risks

- [ ] Seasonal business fluctuation planning (holiday sales, summer slumps)
- [ ] Marketing and user acquisition channel diversification planned
- [ ] Long-term sustainability model validated beyond launch window

# Unity 2D Animation System Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for validating Unity 2D Animation system implementation for 2D game projects. The 2D Animation package enables skeletal animation, sprite rigging, and advanced character animation workflows. This validation ensures 2D Animation integration is robust, performant, and properly configured for production-quality character animation.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. 2D Animation Setup Documentation - Check docs/unity-2d-animation-setup.md
2. Game Architecture Document - Check docs/game-architecture.md for animation system integration
3. 2D Animation Assets - Check sprite libraries, skeleton rigs, and animation clips
4. Package Configuration - Check Packages/manifest.json for 2D Animation packages
5. Character Animation Documentation - Check character setup and animation workflows
6. Performance Configuration - Check 2D animation optimization settings

IMPORTANT: If any required documents are missing or inaccessible, immediately ask the user for their location or content before proceeding.

2D ANIMATION PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the 2D Animation implementation scope:

- Are characters using skeletal animation, sprite swapping, or both?
- What complexity of character rigs and animations are required?
- Is this for cutscene animation, gameplay animation, or both?
- What are the performance requirements for animation playback?

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. Technical Verification - Validate 2D animation setup, rigging, and playback systems
2. Performance Analysis - Check animation performance and memory usage
3. Asset Validation - Verify sprite libraries, rigs, and animation clip quality
4. Integration Testing - Ensure 2D animation integration with gameplay systems

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]

# Unity Visual Scripting Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for validating Unity Visual Scripting implementation across both 2D and 3D game projects. Visual Scripting enables node-based programming for gameplay logic, making development more accessible while maintaining performance. This validation ensures Visual Scripting integration is robust, performant, and properly configured for production use.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. Visual Scripting Setup Documentation - Check docs/unity-visual-scripting-setup.md
2. Game Architecture Document - Check docs/game-architecture.md for Visual Scripting integration
3. Script Graph Assets - Check Visual Scripting graphs in project
4. Package Configuration - Check Packages/manifest.json for Visual Scripting package
5. Type Options Configuration - Check Project Settings > Visual Scripting
6. Custom Node Documentation - If applicable, check custom node implementations

IMPORTANT: If any required documents are missing or inaccessible, immediately ask the user for their location or content before proceeding.

VISUAL SCRIPTING PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the Visual Scripting implementation scope:

- Is Visual Scripting used for core gameplay logic or supplementary features?
- What types of Script Graphs are implemented (State Graphs, Script Graphs)?
- Are there custom Visual Scripting nodes implemented?
- What's the performance impact and optimization strategy?

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. Technical Verification - Validate Script Graph functionality, node connections, and data flow
2. Performance Analysis - Check Visual Scripting runtime overhead and memory usage
3. Integration Testing - Verify Visual Scripting integration with C# scripts and Unity systems
4. Maintainability Assessment - Ensure Visual Scripting graphs are organized and documented

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]

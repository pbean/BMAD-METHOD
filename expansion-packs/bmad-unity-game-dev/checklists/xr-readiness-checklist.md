# Unity XR/VR Readiness Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for validating Unity XR (Extended Reality) and VR readiness for 3D game projects. XR development requires specific considerations for performance, user comfort, interaction design, and platform compatibility. This validation ensures XR implementation is robust, comfortable, and properly optimized for immersive experiences.

XR PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the XR implementation scope:

- What XR platforms are targeted (PC VR, Quest, mobile VR)?
- Is this VR-only, AR-enabled, or mixed reality?
- What interaction methods are required (controllers, hand tracking, gaze)?
- What performance and comfort requirements must be met?

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. Technical Verification - Validate XR SDK integration, device support, and functionality
2. Performance Analysis - Check XR performance meets comfort and quality standards
3. User Experience - Verify XR interactions are intuitive and comfortable
4. Platform Compatibility - Ensure XR works across target devices and platforms

EXECUTION MODE:

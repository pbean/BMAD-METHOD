# 3D Game Architect Checklist

- [ ] **Core Architecture:**
  - [ ] 3D Render Pipeline chosen (URP/HDRP) and configured.
  - [ ] Lighting strategy defined (real-time, baked, or mixed).
  - [ ] Scene management approach for 3D environments is clear.
  - [ ] 3D physics layers and collision matrix are configured.
- [ ] **Performance:**
  - [ ] LOD strategy is defined for complex models.
  - [ ] Occlusion culling is planned for dense scenes.
  - [ ] Static and dynamic batching strategies are clear.
  - [ ] Memory budgets for textures, models, and shaders are set.
- [ ] **Asset Pipeline:**
  - [ ] 3D model import settings are standardized.
  - [ ] Texture import settings (compression, size) are defined.
  - [ ] Material and shader organization is clear.
- [ ] **Scalability:**
  - [ ] Architecture supports adding new 3D levels and assets.
  - [ ] Systems are designed to handle 3D-specific complexities (e.g., 3D pathfinding, complex animations).

# Unity Timeline Implementation Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for validating Unity Timeline system implementation across both 2D and 3D game projects. The Timeline system is critical for creating cutscenes, cinematics, complex animations, and orchestrated gameplay sequences. This validation ensures Timeline integration is robust, performant, and properly configured.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. Timeline Setup Documentation - Check docs/unity-timeline-setup.md
2. Game Architecture Document - Check docs/game-architecture.md for Timeline integration
3. Unity Timeline Assets - Check Assets/Timeline/ directory for Timeline assets
4. Package Configuration - Check Packages/manifest.json for Timeline package
5. Unity Project Settings - Timeline-related project settings
6. Cinemachine Integration - If applicable, check Cinemachine Timeline track setup

IMPORTANT: If any required documents are missing or inaccessible, immediately ask the user for their location or content before proceeding.

TIMELINE PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the Timeline implementation scope:

- Is this Timeline configured for 2D sprite sequences or 3D cinematics?
- What Timeline tracks are required (Animation, Audio, Cinemachine, etc.)?
- Are there custom Timeline tracks implemented?
- What's the target platform performance for Timeline playback?

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. Technical Verification - Validate Timeline assets, tracks, and bindings
2. Performance Analysis - Check Timeline playback performance and memory usage
3. Integration Testing - Verify Timeline integration with other Unity systems
4. Platform Compatibility - Ensure Timeline works across target platforms

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]

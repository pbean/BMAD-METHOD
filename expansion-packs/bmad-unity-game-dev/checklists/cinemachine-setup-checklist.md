VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. Technical Verification - Validate Virtual Camera configurations, targets, and constraints
2. Performance Analysis - Check Cinemachine processing overhead and frame rate impact
3. Integration Testing - Verify Cinemachine integration with input, physics, and Timeline
4. Platform Compatibility - Ensure Cinemachine performs well across target platforms

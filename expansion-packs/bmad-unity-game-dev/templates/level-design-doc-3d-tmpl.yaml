    title: Level Layout
    instruction: |
      Using the data gathered in the subsections of level-creation-guidelines organize the information into a clear structure and identify:
        - Nodes (Each distinct area, room, or significant landmark is a node)
        - Edges (Each connection or path between areas is an edge. Note the nature of the connection (e.g., "Locked Door", "Hallway", "Teleporter"))
        - Key Items/Events (Note where crucial items (like keys) are found and which doors or events they affect.)
      Translate the structured data into a Mermaid flowchart using the graph TD (Top to Down) format.
        - Nodes: Define each area with a unique ID and descriptive text. Use different shapes for different elements:
          - A[Square Brackets for Areas]
          - B{Rhombus for Puzzles/Choices}
          - C((Circle for Items/Events))
          - Start_Node((Start)) and End_Node((End))
        - Edges: Connect nodes using arrows.
          - --> for a standard connection.
          - -- "Link Text" --> to describe the path.
          - -.-> for a dotted line, often useful for showing an item unlocking something elsewhere.
        - Subgraphs: If the level has distinct zones (e.g., "Upstairs," "Basement," "Courtyard"), group the relevant nodes using a subgraph
    examples: |
      ```graph TD
        subgraph "Castle Level"
            A((Start: Outside Gates)) --> B[Great Hall]

            B --> C{Barracks};
            C -- "Defeat Mini-Boss" --> D((Red Key));

            B -- "Red Key Door" --> E[Royal Chambers];
            D -. "Unlocks" .-> E;

            E -- "Defeat Final Boss" --> F((End of Level));
        end
